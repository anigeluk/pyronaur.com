Over the many years of being a developer, I've learned a lot, but I've learned a lot in complete silence. No [learning exhaust](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).

## Perfectionism sucks.

Perfectionism is great, as long as it's something you strive for acknowledging that you're unlikely to ever achieve it. Unfortunately for me, for a very long time I've been obsessed with perfectionism, but not in a healthy way.

I've been obsessed with the idea that whatever I produce has to be perfect and the flip side of that is - it's never perfect, and so my range of action oscillates between not publishing or not starting at all.

In the eyes of a perfectionist, the reasons are always sound.

Can't publish because this thing is just not good enough just yet. Work on it some more. Until you give up and start a new idea.

or

Don't even try to start this thing - you know you'll need to spend months on the idea and it just won't be good enough, so you might as well give up before you even started. Look at all the time I saved you.

## Brutalism

In 2017 a trend swooped through the Twitters for a few weeks called [Brutalism](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/brutalism-antidesign). I thought it's bonkers, and I still sort of do.

But - for every tool there's a purpose. And I think I might just have found the use for brutalism that makes sense to me.

## Action

If brutalist design is what I'm after, I can let my perfectionism loose on it. Go ahead, enjoy your brutally simple goal.

Time and time again in my life I've found that the best things come out of doing something that I feel resistance to. 

Something that's brutally simple, is just not good enough for the perfectionist. So there's the resistance that I've felt for too long.

It's time for action and take the uncomfortable path.
