I've learned a ton throughout the years, but most of it I've learned in complete silence. No [learning exhaust](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). No showing my work, no story, nothing.

## Perfectionism.

Perfectionism is a wonderful thing to pursue, as long as you acknowledge that you're unlikely to ever achieve it. 

I've been obsessed with perfectionism, but not in a healthy way. Since nothing is ever perfect, my range of action so far has been between no action at all - and - investing a lot of work into something until I eventually give up because it's never good enough.

In the eyes of a perfectionist, the reasons are always sound.

"Can't publish because this thing is just not good enough just yet. Work on it some more. Until you give up and start a new idea."

– or –

"Don't even try to start this thing - you know you'll need to spend months on the idea and it just won't be good enough, so you might as well give up before you even started."

So what's the cure?

## Brutalism

In 2017 a trend swooped through the Twitters for a few weeks called [Brutalism](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/brutalism-antidesign). It's truly brutal, in terms of how "well designed" some of those designs were, but there's a lesson that can be learned from Brutalism. It doesn't have to be perfect. All you need is action.

## Action

If brutalist design is what I'm after, I can let my perfectionism loose on it. Go ahead, enjoy your brutally simple goal.

Time and time again in my life I've found that the best things come out of doing something that I feel resistance to. 

Something that's brutally simple, is just not good enough for the perfectionist. So there's the resistance that I've felt for too long.

It's time for action and take the uncomfortable path.
