import { Tweet } from '@astro-community/astro-embed-twitter'



As I was scrolling my Twitter feed today, this jumped out at me:

<Tweet id="https://twitter.com/SimonHoiberg/status/1557737454416801793" />

Do you see the genius?

Simon took book covers, arranged them in a simple layout, and then posted a short tweet about each book in a Twitter thread.

Arranging things is genius?
<br />No.

Book reviews are genius?
<br />No.

Posting images on Twitter is genius?
<br />No.

So then what?
<br />_You can probably guess by the post title..._.

## Stand out, a bit

Simon could have just posted a ðŸ§µ without an image with book descriptions.
And that's what everyone is doing these days with Twitter threads:

import FakeSimonTweet from '@components/one-offs/FakeSimonTweet';

<FakeSimonTweet />

Instead, he spent a little extra effort creating custom images for the group of books and each of the books and made it look like it was a part of a series.

All it takes sometimes is a little effort compared to everyone else.

And that is what stood out to me.

To stand out, know where the line is, and then take that extra step.
